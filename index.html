				 <h2>My Strength and Weaknesses</h2>
				 <p>Strength and Weaknesses in terms of IT field? As an IT student, one of my greatest strengths is that I have the capacity to be a well-organized person. I prefer to do what I have to do and give priority to what is more important. It helps me to plan and achieve my work and reach significant deadlines by doing this. And One of my weaknesses is not having much confidence in myself. When I make choices, I begin to start questioning myself. I really want to make sure that I make something that's right.</p>

				<h1>Favorite Artist</h1>
				<h2>Lee Ji-eun</h2>
				<p>Professionally known as IU. A South Korean singer-songwriter and actress. More than being pretty and a good singer, she has also shown many times that she has a good heart, always helping those in need. She is very generous and caring for her fans and staff. She's a great actress, a talented musician, and she has a unique voice as well as a composer. Absolutely stunning inside and outside.</p>

					<h1>Favorite Viand</h1>
					<h2>Sisig</h2>
					<p>A perfect example of our local cuisine is Sisig. It's a Filipino dish that is unique and identifiable. It is marinated with soy sauce and vinegar for its distinct flavor. I want the best when it is served on a sizzling plate and served with an egg, mayonnaise on top, and a spicy one.</p>

						<h1>Favorite Series</h1>
						<h2>Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo</h2>
						<p>Every character in this series has meaningful roles, including the minor ones. Although it feels a little hurried at times. It has a lot of surprising mysteries along the way. And everybody has an opportunity to showcase their character. The incredibly beautiful soundtrack is another asset. Upon watching, I’ve noticed how the creative director, production designer, and costume heads take a lot of time to study and create a good set that is suited for the drama’s timeline. The ending? It felt a little heartbreaking because the main lovers/character didn't even have a good time to be with each other. </p>

							<h1>Favorite Flavor</h1>
							<h2>Cookies and Cream</h2>
							<p>It has chunks of cookies that give an extra taste. It's sweet and creamy which I like the most. For me, this kind of flavor is perfect for any treats like milk teas, ice cream, biscuits and even cakes. And it's delicious on its own. </p>
